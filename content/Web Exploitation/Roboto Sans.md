In this task, you need to extract a flag from a web application, and not necessarily directly from the web application itself. <br><br>
First check `robots.txt` file:

Looks like base64. Trying decode this. I use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/):

anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==    --> js/myfile.txt 
```

Let's try substituting this path into the URL:
