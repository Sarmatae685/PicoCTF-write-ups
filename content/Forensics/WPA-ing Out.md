In this task, we need to crack a WPA-protected password. The task provides hints, namely to use `aircrack-ng` for cracking and the `rockyou.txt` dictionary for obtaining values for brute force. But in general, this task can be solved in several ways.

---

## I method: aircrack-ng

```bash
aircrack-ng -help
```

We are interested in the option for specifying the path to the dictionary:

```bash
aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt wpa-ing_out.pcap
```

To accomplish the task, this is sufficient:

`picoCTF{mickeymouse}`


## II method: hashcat

`hashcat` operates in numerous modes, one of which is WPA. The modes suitable for this are listed here: [*click*](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=cracking_wpawpa2) : 

![image_4](../assets/images/WPA-ing-Out_image_4.png)

Each mod has its own identifier, specified via `-m`.

To crack the WPA password, we first need to convert `wpa-ing_out.pcap` to the appropriate format. It also mentioned in source from above: [*click*](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=cracking_wpawpa2)

```bash
hcxpcapngtool -o hashCrack.hc22000 wpa-ing_out.pcap
```

![image_6](../assets/images/WPA-ing-Out_image_6.png)


From the inside it looks like this:

```
WPA*02*32989a79f86d839eadd1aaa21c03d3f9*005f674f6a1a*1cbfce17b0be*476f6e655f53757266696e67*25ef6a1eeb8bb313b72ec06dfdd149549b1ace84ff992fbeb380e2591ccac1d2*01030077020109000000000000000000018451310d2c932f59694295cef35c115d59d4499436f7bec311b233108bbc1470000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001830160100000fac020100000fac020100000fac0200000000*82
```

Launch cracking process:

```bash
hashcat -m 22000 hashCrack.hc22000 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

The phrase "Gone_Surfing" is the name of the WiFi network (access point) to which all devices involved in the transfer were connected.  


![image_8](../assets/images/WPA-ing-Out_image_8.png)


This data can be used to decrypt traffic in Wireshark.

First, let's look at the protocol hierarchy:  


![image_9](../assets/images/WPA-ing-Out_image_9.png)


This is what it looks like BEFORE decryption. There are no transfer protocols from the TCP/IP stack, as everything is encrypted. 

Для розшифрування використаємо пару `<password>:<SSID>`:

```
mickeymouse:Gone_Surfing
```

![image_10](../assets/images/WPA-ing-Out_image_10.gif)


The protocol hierarchy has become more detailed, indicating that the key is correct.

However, there is no mention of the flag in the decrypted traffic in UDP/TCP streams.:

Therefore, the task was simply to crack the password using a dictionary.

`picoCTF{mickeymouse}`
