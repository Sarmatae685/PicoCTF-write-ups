Download and check `file advanced-potion-making`:


```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/pico/advanced-potion-making]
└─$ file advanced-potion-making 
advanced-potion-making: data
```

![image_2](../assets/images/advanced-potion-making_image_2.png)


Open the file in `ghex` and you will immediately see IHDR, sRGB, gAMA, pHYs, IDAT chunks, which indicates that it is a PNG, but some bytes have been changed.

Let's start by checking whether the PNG signature has been broken. More sigs here: ([File sigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures))

```

In file:

Replace and try to open Eye of Gnome `eog advanced-potion-making` 


![image_4](../assets/images/advanced-potion-making_image_4.png)


```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/pico/advanced-potion-making]
└─$ pngcheck -v advanced-potion-making
zlib warning:  different version (expected 1.2.13, using 1.3.1)

File: advanced-potion-making (30372 bytes)

```


```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/pico/advanced-potion-making]
└─$ identify advanced-potion-making

```


It is clear from above output that the problem lies in the bytes that indicate the length of the IHDR chunk. 

> [!TIP]
> You can read more about the structure of the IHDR chunk and CRC calculation in my cheat sheet: [*click*](../../notes/IHDR-chunk%20structure%20and%20CRC%20calculate.md)

We'll focus on IHDR-length only.  


![image_5](../assets/images/IHDR_structure.png)


I googled "Invalid IHDR length" and found on Stack Overflow an [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54845745/not-able-to-read-ihdr-chunk-of-a-png-file) about IHDR-chunk structure (I took the image from there).
As it can be seen from image, 4 bytes IHDR come right after PNG-signature. **IHDR length is fixed and always equal to 13 bytes**! 


In hex `13` is `0D`. In file it looks like:  

![image_6](../assets/images/advanced-potion-making_image_6.png)


```
13(dec) → 0D(hex) → 00 00 00 0D
```

![image_7](../assets/images/advanced-potion-making_image_7.png)


```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/pico/advanced-potion-making]
└─$ file advanced-potion-making

To open this image, you need to add its format to the name:


```bash
mv advanced-potion-making advanced-potion-making.png
eog advanced-potion-making.png
```

After searching for various Photo Forensics tools, I settled on [this tool](https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#error-level-analysis). I tried various settings suggested here and settled on `Error Level Analysis`:
