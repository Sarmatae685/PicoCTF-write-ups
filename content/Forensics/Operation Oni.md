In this task, we need to extract the public SSH key from the `.img` file and use it to connect to the remote host where the flag will be located.


## Autopsy

First, let's set up the Autopsy environment by creating a project in the same directory as the file we are investigating.

### Create New Case

Create a `New Case` for research:

### Choose `disk.img`  

Next, we download `disk.img` for further analysis:

### Search for SSH-key

Now we need to find the key that will be used to log in. 

![image_5](../assets/images/Operation-Oni_image_5.gif)

As can be seen from the command in the task description, the file name with the key `key_file`: 
```bash
ssh -i key_file -p 51009 ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net
```
<br>

## VM Kali


### Login to `ctf-player`

### chmod

For the key to work correctly, you need to change its access rights:

```bash
chmod 600 key_file 
```
