This task boils down to simply reviewing packages and looking for clues.

Found: `username root    password toor624a8b6}`

iBwaWNvQ1RGe1 Flag is close=
gc2VjcmV0OiBwaWNvQ1RGe
```


None of these entries produce readable text when decoded from base64.

And finally, in package 507, we find the flag:

![image_5](../assets/images/PcapPoisoning_image_5.png)

`picoCTF{P64P_4N4L7S1S_SU55355FUL_4624a8b6}`
