Given text:

```
heTfl g as iicpCTo{7F4NRP051N5_16_35P3X51N3_V6E5926A}4
```

and a hint that it is worth breaking this text into blocks of 3 and seeing in what order the characters were rearranged.

---

In the first block, the word "`The`" is clearly visible:

```
213     123
heT --> The
```

Following this principle, I divide the entire text into blocks of 3 characters and form 2 columns: with mixed and correct order:  

```
231 123 look at the last -->  first -->  middle
