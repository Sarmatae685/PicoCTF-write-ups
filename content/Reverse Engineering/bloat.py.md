In this task, we have obfuscated code that decrypts the flag and a file with the encrypted flag itself. We need to understand its logic and make the code more understandable.

We have a file called `bloat.flag`, which has an array of characters from which readable strings are collected by index, and variable/function names in the style of `arg<num>` to hide the actual logic of their work.

First, I take all the character combinations by index, put them in a separate file, and see what strings are hidden there:

I also copy the main function, which probably decrypts the flag based on the password that the program asks us for when it starts.

Next, I replace these character combinations by index with the readable strings we learned, and make notes, how functions and variables were previously called.:

Now I will try to "beautify" all the code (or almost all of it):


![image_5](../assets/images/bloat.py_image_5.png)


It becomes clear that the program is waiting for `_password "happychance"` to start performing operations with the flag and eventually output it using the `read_the_flag()` method. 

In fact, it would have been enough to find out the secret word "happychance" to complete this task, since the **obfuscated version** of the program **was working**, but this improved our understanding of the program's logic.
